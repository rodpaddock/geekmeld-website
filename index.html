    <h2>Welcome to ATX Geek Meld</h2>
    
    <p>
    ATX Geek Meld is a forum where developers from diverse backgrounds meet to show off
    what interests them. We are programming language/development tool agnostic. The 
    purpose of this group is to provide a forum where developers can meet and learn from
    each other.
    </p>
    <p>
    The format of these meetings will not be the standard user group format. Meaning we
    will have no set speakers or agendas. The meetings will be organically driven by
    those that attend and those that choose to participate. Many years ago I
    participated in a meeting of a very diverse set of developers. We just sat around a
    table and discussed ideas, wrote on a white board and used a projector to show off
    what we were currently working on or interested in. I want to repeat the 
    atmosphere of that original meeting.
